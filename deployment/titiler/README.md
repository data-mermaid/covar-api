# TiTiler Deploy

These are CDK stacks for deploying the TiTiler on either Lambda or ECS. The lambda deploy in the TiTIler repo is broken, so we are using a modified version. This stack is not written to be deployed locally, only through Github actions.

To deploy, see the Github action workflow [here](.github/workflows/lambda_dev.yml.)
